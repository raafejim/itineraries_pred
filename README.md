Dataset: 

Expedia flight prices (2022- 2023)

Description: 

The dataset contains information on Expedia flight tickets between April 16, 2022 and October 5, 2022. The following airports are included: ATL, DFW, DEN, ORD, LAX, CLT, MIA, JFK, EWR, SFO, DTW, BOS, PHL, LGA, IAD, OAK.It is formatted as a CSV file and contains 31.09 GBs of information. Some key characteristics about each flight ticket include base fare and total pricing, seat availability, and travel patterns between each airport. I employ multiple regression models to predict the total fare of a ticket booked on Expedia, considering factors such as the starting and destination airports, travel duration, and seating availability (seats remaining).
